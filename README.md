## Unit 2 | Homework Assignment: Automate Your Day Job with Python

### Background
You've made it! It's time to put away the Excel sheet and join the big leagues. Welcome to the world of programming with Python. In this homework assignment, you'll be using the concepts you've learned to complete the required PyBank Python activity, and if you wish to stretch your skills even further, the optional PyRamen Python activity. Both activities present a real-world situation in which your newfound Python skills will come in handy. These activities are far from easy, though, so expect some hard work ahead!

### Before You Begin


Create a new GitHub repo called python-homework. Then, clone it to your computer.


In your local git repository, create a directory for both of the Python activities. Use folder names that correspond to the activities: PyBank and PyRamen.


In each folder you just created, add a new file called main.ipynb. Remember that to create this file you will need to use JupyterLab to correctly generate the .ipynb file format. This will be the main notebook to run for each analysis.


Push the above changes to GitHub.



### PyBank (Required)

In this activity, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will be provided with a financial dataset in this file: budget_data.csv. This dataset is composed of two columns, Date and Profit/Losses. (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting, so the records are simple.)
Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:


The total number of months included in the dataset.


The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.


The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.


The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.


The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.


Your resulting analysis should look similar to the following:

### Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 86
Total: $38382578
Average  Change: $-2315.12
Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)


Your final script should print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

## PyRamen (Optional)


### Background
Welcome to Ichiban Ramen!
Opening a ramen shop has always been your dream, and now it's finally been realized––you're closing out on your second year of sales! Like last year, you need to analyze your business's financial performance by cross-referencing your sales data with your internal menu data to figure out revenues and costs for the year.
This year, you also want to analyze how well your business did on a per-product basis (as you have several choices of ramen) in order to better understand which products are doing well, which are doing poorly, and, ultimately, which products may need to be removed or changed.
You tried doing this type of per-product analysis last year in Excel, but you were not able to keep your reports up-to-date with your current sales data. Therefore, you need to innovate. With more customers and more data to process, you'll need a tool that will allow you to automate your calculations in a manner that scales with your business.
Enter Python! Python provides a wide range of capabilities for handling data, harnessing the power of low-level Python data structures and high-level development libraries, all the while supporting the automation and scalability needs for a growing enterprise.
In this homework assignment, you will need to:


Read the Data


Manipulate the Data
